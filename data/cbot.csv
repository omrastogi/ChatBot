Is Google search engine an AI?,RankBrain is an algorithm learning AI system that has been in use by Google since 2015. It help process search results and provide more relevant answers for users.
What are the current capabilities of artificial intelligence?,Google Duplex can make phone calls to make restaurant and hair appointments. Google Deep Mind won a global Starcraft game challenge against gaming pros. Amazon uses AI for book and product recommendations. Websites are using Chat-bots to answer basic customer queries. Airports are using image recognition for staff security. Rolls Royce is using AI for predictive maintenance and servicing of airplane engines. Informatica is using AI for compliance and data gathering and analysis purposes. Fintech is using AI to combine and analyse more diverse datasets. In Healthcare AI can help analyse more data for preventative medicine. Baidu in China is producing self driving buses for large cities.
What is deep learning with AI?,Deep learning uses a certain set of machine learning algorithms that run in multiple layers.
Can artificial intelligence compete with human intelligence?,"""People will always be faster to adjust than computers, because that's what humans are optimized to do."""
What are the advantages of Natural Language Processing?,"NLP is a way for computers to analyse, understand and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way."
What are the dangers of artificial intelligence?,Dangers include having control of critical infrastructure like the power grid and going out of control or being hacked.
What is the future of artificial intelligence?,"Automated transport, taking over dangerous jobs, robots working with humans, improved elderly care, cyborg (organic/bio-mechanic) organisms, environment monitoring and response for climate change goals."
What is the state of the art in AI problem solving?,Finding the best move in chess. Finding the best sequence of stock trades. Finding the best candidate for a job in less time. Analyzing post surgery patients to prevent relapse and re-hospitalization. Using continuous patient monitoring to gain baselines and early detection of problems. Analyzing CCTV video for anomalous behavior and security threat. IBM Watson can find insights quicker than humans. AI is being used to review and suggest corrections in contracts. AI is being used for 1000's of customer questions per month with 95% accuracy provided in seconds.
What are the advantages of artificial intelligence?,"AI is a powerful tool for addressing a variety of challenges, such as voice translation or wireless channel estimation, that are difficult to model or solve with traditional methods. For the end user, AI seamlessly offers enhanced experiences, personal assistance, and automation of repetitive tasks. In addition, AI can make devices more energy efficient and allow us to interact with them in more convenient ways, like with an always-on voice user interface."
What are the challenges surrounding AI models?,"The biggest challenges AI models face are how to be more power efficient, how to learn from less data, how to learn from unlabeled data (unsupervised learning), and how to generalize across multiple tasks. The industry is also focused on making AI unbiased and explainable, such that we know how it works, where it fails, and how to quantify confidence levels. For example, we want to understand how the AI used for autonomous driving is deciding how to drive safely on a road under various environments and weather conditions."
Is there a way to eliminate bias in AI algorithms?,"When thereâ€™s bias in the data set that trains an AI model, the model will contain the same bias. A way to address this bias is by collecting robust and diverse data. For example, in distributed learning on smartphones, you may want to sample data from different geographies and demographics. If bias is noticed in algorithms, the data should be examined to determine whether new data should be added."
What is edge computing?,"Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, saving bandwidth and improving response time as a result. Edge computing may have different meanings depending on context: the edge of a network, the edge of a cloud, or the edge device. For example, edge computing could mean on-device processing for a smartphone or IoT device, or it could mean processing in the edge cloud or close to a base station for a cellular network provider."
What is computer vision?,Computer vision enables computers to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. Deep learning has brought tremendous advancements in computer vision.
What is distributed intelligence?,"Distributed intelligence is the result of AI processing that happens jointly on the device, edge cloud, and/or central cloud processing. A low-latency, high-reliability, and high-capacity link is essential for enabling distributed intelligence and allowing workloads to be processed in the most appropriate place. This is why 5G is so important for enabling distributed intelligence for a variety of use cases."
How do mobile phones use AI?,"AI is running on your phone behind the scenes for a variety of use cases, inferencing neural networks on your device to help you take better photos, understand a different language, identify music, and assist with gaming. This is also known as on-device AI."
